# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Since the dataset we use in our project is too large to upload on Github, we decided to upload it on Google Drive and could be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KS2roQgvcd8dGJLcXhNxyTMwowG9x-BP/view?usp=sharing.
